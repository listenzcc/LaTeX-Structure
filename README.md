# LaTeX-Structure
Parse the structure of LaTeX script, and display it in web browser.

## A Tip
It is really a **Stupid Idea** to put a '-' between the package name words.
The '-' will cause the folder name can not be used as a package name.
An solution is to change the '-' into '_', to formulate the **New Project Name**.
